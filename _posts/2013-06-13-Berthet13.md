title: Complexity Theoretic Lower Bounds for Sparse Principal Component Detection
abstract: 'In the context of sparse principal component detection, we bring evidence
  towards the existence of a statistical price to pay for computational efficiency.
  We measure the performance of a test by the smallest signal strength that it can
  detect and we propose a computationally efficient method based on semidefinite programming.
  We also prove that the statistical performance of this test cannot be strictly improved
  by any computationally efficient method. Our results can be viewed as complexity
  theoretic lower bounds conditionally on the assumptions that some instances of the
  planted clique problem cannot be solved in randomized polynomial time. '
