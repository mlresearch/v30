title: 'Learning Halfspaces Under Log-Concave Densities: Polynomial Approximations
  and Moment Matching'
abstract: We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for agnostically learning any
  function of a constant number of halfspaces with respect to any log-concave distribution
  (for any constant accuracy parameter).  This result was not known even for the case
  of PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces. We give two very different proofs
  of this result.  The first develops a theory of polynomial approximation for log-concave
  measures and constructs a low-degree L_1 polynomial approximator for sufficiently
  smooth functions.  The second uses techniques related to the classical moment problem
  to obtain sandwiching polynomials.  Both approaches deviate significantly from known
  Fourier-based methods, where essentially all previous work required the underlying
  distribution to have some product structure. Additionally, we show that in the smoothed-analysis
  setting, the above results hold with respect to distributions that have sub-exponential
  tails, a property satisfied by many natural and well-studied distributions in machine
  learning.
