title: Passive Learning with Target Risk
abstract: 'In this paper we consider learning in passive setting but with a slight
  modification. We assume that the target expected loss, also referred to as target
  risk, is provided in advance for  learner as  prior knowledge. Unlike most studies
  in the learning theory  that only incorporate the prior knowledge into the generalization
  bounds, we are able to explicitly utilize the target risk in the learning process.
  Our analysis reveals a surprising result on the sample complexity of learning: by
  exploiting the target risk in the learning algorithm,  we show that when the loss
  function is both strongly convex and smooth, the sample complexity reduces to \mathcalO(\log
  \left(\frac1ε\right)), an exponential improvement compared to the sample complexity
  \mathcalO(\frac1ε) for learning with strongly convex loss functions.  Furthermore,  our
  proof is constructive and is based on a computationally efficient stochastic optimization
  algorithm  for such settings which demonstrate that the  proposed algorithm is practically
  useful.'
