title: Sharp analysis of low-rank  kernel matrix approximations
abstract: We consider supervised learning problems within the positive-definite kernel
  framework, such as kernel ridge regression, kernel logistic regression or the support
  vector machine. With  kernels leading to infinite-dimensional feature spaces, a
  common practical limiting difficulty is the necessity of computing the kernel matrix,
  which most frequently leads to algorithms with running time at least quadratic in
  the number of observations n, i.e., O(n^2). Low-rank approximations of the kernel
  matrix are often considered as they allow the reduction of  running time complexities  to
  O(p^2 n), whereÂ p is the rank of the approximation. The practicality of such methods
  thus depends on the required rank p. In this paper, we show that for approximations
  based on a random subset of columns of the original kernel matrix, the rank p may
  be chosen to be linear in the \emphdegrees of freedom associated with the problem,
  a quantity which is classically used in the statistical analysis of such methods,
  and is often seen as the implicit number of parameters of non-parametric estimators.
  This result enables simple algorithms that have sub-quadratic running time complexity,
  but provably exhibit the same \emphpredictive performance than existing algorithms,
  for any given problem instance, and not only for worst-case situations.
