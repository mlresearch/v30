title: Blind Signal Separation in the Presence of Gaussian Noise
abstract: A prototypical blind signal separation problem  is the so-called cocktail
  party problem, with n people talking simultaneously and n different microphones
  within a room. The goal is to  recover  each speech signal  from the microphone
  inputs. Mathematically this can be modeled by assuming that we are given samples
  from a n-dimensional random variable X=AS, where S is a vector whose coordinates
  are independent random variables corresponding to each speaker. The objective is
  to recover the  matrix A^-1 given random samples from X. A range of techniques  collectively
  known as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been proposed to address this
  problem in the signal processing and machine learning literature. Many of these
  techniques are based on using the kurtosis or other cumulants to recover the components.
  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving the blind signal separation
  problem in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, when we are given samples from
  X=AS+η, where ηis drawn from an unknown, not necessarily spherical n-dimensional
  Gaussian distribution. Our approach is based on a method for decorrelating a sample
  with additive Gaussian noise under the assumption that the underlying distribution
  is a linear transformation of a distribution with independent components. Our decorrelation
  routine is based on the properties of cumulant tensors and can be combined with
  any standard cumulant-based method for ICA to get an algorithm that is provably
  robust in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive polynomial bounds for sample
  complexity and error propagation of our method.
