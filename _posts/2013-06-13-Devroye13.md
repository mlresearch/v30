title: Prediction by random-walk perturbation
abstract: 'We propose a version of the follow-the-perturbed-leader online prediction
  algorithm in which the cumulative losses are perturbed by independent symmetric
  random walks. The forecaster is shown to achieve an expected regret of the optimal
  order O(\sqrtn \log N) where n is the time horizon and N is the number of experts.
  More importantly, it is shown that the forecaster changes its prediction at most
  O(\sqrtn \log N) times, in expectation. We also extend the analysis to online combinatorial
  optimization and show that even in this more general setting, the forecaster rarely
  switches between experts while having a regret of near-optimal order. '
