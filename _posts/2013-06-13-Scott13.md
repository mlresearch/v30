title: 'Classification with Asymmetric Label Noise: Consistency and Maximal Denoising'
abstract: In many real-world classification problems, the labels of training examples
  are randomly corrupted. Thus, the set of training examples for each class is contaminated
  by examples of the other class. Previous theoretical work on this problem assumes
  that the two classes are separable, that the label noise is independent of the true
  class label, or that the noise proportions for each class are known. We introduce
  a general framework for classification with label noise that eliminates these assumptions.
  Instead, we give assumptions ensuring identifiability and the existence of a consistent
  estimator of the optimal risk, with associated estimation strategies. For any arbitrary
  pair of contaminated distributions, there is a unique pair of non-contaminated distributions
  satisfying the proposed assumptions, and we argue that this solution corresponds
  in a certain sense to maximal denoising. In particular, we find that learning in
  the presence of label noise is possible even when the class-conditional distributions
  overlap and the label noise is not symmetric. A key to our approach is a universally
  consistent estimator of the maximal proportion of one distribution that is present
  in another, a problem we refer to asâ€œmixture proportion estimation. This work is
  motivated by a problem in nuclear particle classification.
