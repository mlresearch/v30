title: A Tensor Spectral Approach to Learning Mixed Membership Community Models
abstract: Modeling community formation and detecting hidden communities in networks
  is a well studied problem. However, theoretical analysis of  community detection
  has been mostly limited to models with non-overlapping communities such as the stochastic
  block model. In this paper, we remove this restriction, and consider a family of
  probabilistic network models with overlapping communities, termed as the mixed membership
  Dirichlet model, first introduced   in Aioroldi et. al (2008). This model allows
  for nodes to have fractional memberships in multiple communities and assumes that
  the community memberships are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. We propose a
  unified  approach to learning these models via a   tensor spectral decomposition
  method. Our estimator is based on  low-order  moment tensor of the observed network,
  consisting of  3-star counts. Our learning method is fast and is based on   simple
  linear algebra operations, e.g. singular value decomposition and tensor power iterations.
  We provide guaranteed recovery of community memberships and model parameters and
  present a careful finite sample analysis of our learning method. Additionally, our
  results  match the best known scaling requirements in the special case of the stochastic
  block model.
