title: Online Learning for Time Series Prediction
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of predicting a time series using
  the ARMA (autoregressive moving average) model, under minimal assumptions on the
  noise terms. Using regret minimization techniques, we develop effective online learning
  algorithms for the prediction problem, \emphwithout assuming that the noise terms
  are Gaussian, identically distributed or even independent. Furthermore, we show
  that our algorithmâ€™s performances asymptotically approaches the performance of the
  best ARMA model in hindsight.
