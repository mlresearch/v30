title: Estimation of Extreme Values and Associated Level Sets of a Regression Function
  via Selective Sampling
abstract: We propose a new method for estimating the locations and the value of an
  absolute maximum (minimum) of a function from the observations contaminated by random
  noise. Our goal is to solve the problem under minimal regularity and shape constraints.
  In particular, we do not assume differentiability of a function nor that its maximum
  is attained at a single point. We provide tight upper and lower bounds for the performance
  of proposed estimators. Our method is adaptive with respect to the unknown parameters
  of the problem over a large class of underlying distributions.
