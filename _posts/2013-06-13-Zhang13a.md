title: Recovering the Optimal Solution by Dual Random Projection
abstract: Random projection has been widely used in data classification. It maps high-dimensional
  data into a low-dimensional subspace in order to reduce the computational cost in
  solving the related optimization problem. While previous studies are focused on
  analyzing the classification performance of using random projection, in this work,
  we consider the recovery problem, i.e., how to accurately recover the optimal solution
  to the original optimization problem in the high-dimensional space based on the
  solution learned from the subspace spanned by random projections. We present a simple
  algorithm, termed Dual Random Projection, that uses the dual solution of the low-dimensional
  optimization problem to recover the optimal solution to the original problem. Our
  theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, the proposed algorithm
  is able to accurately recover the optimal solution to the original problem, provided
  that the data matrix is of low rank or can be well approximated by a low rank matrix.
