title: Regret Minimization for Branching Experts
abstract: We study regret minimization bounds in which the dependence on the number
  of experts is replaced by measures of the realized complexity of the expert class.
  The measures we consider are defined in retrospect given the realized losses. We
  concentrate on two interesting cases. In the first, our measure of complexity is
  the number of different “leading experts”, namely, experts that were best at some
  point in time. We derive regret bounds that depend only on this measure, independent
  of the total number of experts. We also consider a case where all experts remain
  grouped in just a few clusters in terms of their realized cumulative losses. Here
  too, our regret bounds depend only on the number of clusters determined in retrospect,
  which serves as a measure of complexity. Our results are obtained as special cases
  of a more general analysis for a setting of branching experts,where the set of experts
  may grow over time according to a tree-like structure, determined by an adversary.
  For this setting of branching experts, we give algorithms and analysis that cover
  both the full information and the bandit scenarios.
