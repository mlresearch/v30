title: Optimal Probability Estimation  with Applications to Prediction and Classification
abstract: Via a unified viewpoint of probability estimation, classification,and prediction,
  we derive a uniformly-optimal combined-probability estimator, construct a classifier
  that uniformly approaches the error of the best possible label-invariant classifier,
  and improve existing results on pattern prediction and compression.
