title: Beating Bandits in Gradually Evolving Worlds
abstract: Consider the online convex optimization problem, in which a player has to
  choose actions iteratively and suffers corresponding losses according to some convex
  loss functions, and the goal is to minimize the regret. In the full-information
  setting, the player after choosing her action can observe the whole loss function
  in that round, while in the bandit setting, the only information the player can
  observe is the loss value of that action. Designing such bandit algorithms appears
  challenging, as the best regret currently achieved for general convex loss functions
  is much higher than that in the full-information setting, while for strongly convex
  loss functions, there is even a regret lower bound which is exponentially higher
  than that achieved in the full-information setting. To aim for smaller regrets,
  we adopt a relaxed two-point bandit setting in which the player can play two actions
  in each round and observe the loss values of those two actions. Moreover, we consider
  loss functions parameterized by their deviation D, which measures how fast they
  evolve, and we study how regrets depend on D. We show that two-point bandit algorithms
  can in fact achieve regrets matching those in the full-information setting in terms
  of D. More precisely, for convex loss functions, we achieve a regret of O(\sqrtD),
  while for strongly convex loss functions, we achieve a regret of O(\ln D), which
  is much smaller than the Î©(\sqrtD) lower bound in the traditional bandit setting.
