title: 'A Tale of Two Metrics: Simultaneous Bounds on Competitiveness and Regret'
abstract: 'We consider algorithms for “smoothed online convex optimization” problems,
  a variant of the class of online convex optimization problems that is strongly related
  to metrical task systems. Prior literature on these problems has focused on two
  performance metrics: regret and the competitive ratio. There exist known algorithms
  with sublinear regret and known algorithms with constant competitive ratios; however,
  no known algorithm achieves both simultaneously. We show that this is due to a fundamental
  incompatibility between these two metrics - no algorithm (deterministic or randomized)
  can achieve sublinear regret and a constant competitive ratio, even in the case
  when the objective functions are linear. However, we also exhibit an algorithm that,
  for the important special case of one dimensional decision spaces, provides sublinear
  regret while maintaining a competitive ratio that grows arbitrarily slowly.'
