title: Excess risk bounds for multitask learning with trace norm regularization
abstract: Trace norm regularization is a popular method of multitask learning. We
  give excess risk bounds with explicit dependence on the number of tasks, the number
  of examples per task and properties of the data distribution. The bounds are independent
  of the dimension of the input space, which may be infinite as in the case of reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces. A byproduct of the proof are bounds on the expected norm
  of sums of random positive semidefinite matrices with subexponential moments.
