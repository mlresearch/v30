title: Boosting with the Logistic Loss is Consistent
abstract: This manuscript provides optimization guarantees, generalization bounds,
  and statistical consistency results for AdaBoost variants which replace the exponential
  loss with the logistic and similar losses (specifically, twice differentiable convex
  losses which are Lipschitz and tend to zero on one side).The heart of the analysis
  is to show that, in lieu of explicit regularization and constraints, the structure
  of the problem is fairly rigidly controlled by the source distribution itself. The
  first control of this type is in the separable case, where a distribution-dependent
  relaxed weak learning rate induces speedy convergence with high probability over
  any sample. Otherwise, in the nonseparable case, the convex surrogate risk itself
  exhibits distribution-dependent levels of curvature, and consequently the algorithmâ€™s
  output has small norm with high probability.
