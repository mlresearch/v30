title: A Theoretical Analysis of NDCG Type Ranking Measures
abstract: Ranking has been extensively studied in information retrieval, machine learning
  and statistics. A central problem in ranking is to design a ranking measure for
  evaluation of ranking functions. State of the art leaning to rank methods often
  train a ranking function by using a ranking measure as the objective to maximize.
  In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used NDCG type
  ranking measures. We analyze the behavior of these ranking measures as the number
  of objects to rank getting large. We first show that, whatever the ranking function
  is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the
  number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result seems
  to imply that NDCG cannot distinguish good and bad ranking functions, contradicting
  to the empirical success of NDCG in many applications. Our next main result is a
  theorem which shows that although NDCG converge to the same limit for all ranking
  functions, it has distinguishability for ranking functions in a strong sense. We
  then investigate NDCG with other possible discount. Specifically we characterize
  the class of feasible discount functions for NDCG. We also compare the limiting
  behavior and the power of distinguishability of these feasible NDCG type measures
  to the standard NDCG. We next turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k.
  The most popular NDCG@k uses a combination of a slow logarithmic decay and a hard
  cut-off as its discount. So a natural question is why not simply use a smooth discount
  with fast decay? We show that if the decay is too fast, then the NDCG measure does
  not have strong power of distinguishability and even not converge. Finally, feasible
  NDCG@k are also discussed.
