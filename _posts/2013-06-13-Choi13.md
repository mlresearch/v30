title: Polynomial Time Optimal Query Algorithms for Finding Graphs with Arbitrary
  Real Weights
abstract: We consider the problem of finding the edges of a hidden weighted graph
  and their weights by using a certain type of queries as few times as possible, with
  focusing on two types of queries with additive property. For a set of vertices,
  the additive query asks the sum of weights of the edges with both ends in the set.
  For a pair of disjoint sets of vertices, the cross-additive query asks the sum of
  weights of the edges crossing between the two sets. These queries were motivated
  by DNA sequencing, population genetics, and artificial intelligence, and have been
  paid considerable attention to in computational learning. In this paper, we achieve
  an ultimate goal of recent years for graph finding with the two types of queries,
  by constructing the first polynomial time algorithms with optimal query complexity
  for the general class of graphs with n vertices and at most m edges in which the
  weights of edges are arbitrary real numbers. The algorithms are randomized and their
  query complexities are O(\fracm \log n\log m). These bounds improve the best known
  by a factor of \log m, and settle the open problem posed in some papers including
  [Choi and Kim, Optimal query complexity bounds for finding graphs, STOC 2008].  To
  build key components for graph finding, we consider the coin weighing problem with
  a spring scale. The problem itself has been paid much attention to in a long history
  of combinatorial search. We construct the first polynomial time algorithm with optimal
  query complexity for the general case in which the weight differences between counterfeit
  and authentic coins are arbitrary real numbers. We also construct the first polynomial
  time optimal query algorithm for finding the Fourier coefficients of a certain class
  of pseudo-Boolean functions.
