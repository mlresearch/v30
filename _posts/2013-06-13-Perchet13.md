title: Approachability, fast and slow
abstract: Approachability has become a central tool in the analysis of repeated games
  and online learning. A player plays a repeated vector-valued game against Nature
  and her objective is to have her long-term average reward inside some target set.  The
  celebrated results of Blackwell provide a 1/\sqrtn convergence rate of the expected
  point-to-set distance if this is achievable, i.e., if the set is approachable. In
  this paper we provide a  characterization for the convergence rates of approachability
  and show that in some cases a set can be approached with a 1/n rate. Our characterization
  is solely based on a combination of geometric properties of the set with properties
  of the repeated game, and not on additional restrictive assumptions on Natureâ€™s
  behavior.
