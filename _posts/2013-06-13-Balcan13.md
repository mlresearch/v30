title: Active and passive learning of linear separators under log-concave distributions
abstract: We prove that active learning provides an exponential improvement over PAC
  (passive) learning of homogeneous linear separators under nearly log-concave distributions.
  Building on this, we provide a computationally efficient PAC algorithm with optimal
  (up to a constant factor) sample complexity for such problems. This resolves an
  open question of (Long, 1995, 2003; Bshouty et al., 2009) concerning the sample
  complexity of efficient PAC algorithms under the uniform distribution in the unit
  ball. Moreover, it provides the first bound for a polynomial-time  PAC algorithm
  that is tight for an interesting infinite class of hypothesis functions under a
  general class of data-distributions, providing significant progress towards  a long
  standing open question of (Ehrenfeucht et al., 1989; Blumer et al., 1989). We also
  provide new bounds for active and passive learning in the case that the data might
  not be linearly separable, both in the agnostic case and and under the Tsybakov
  low-noise condition. To derive our results, we provide new  structural results for
  (nearly) log-concave distributions, which might be of independent interest  as well.
