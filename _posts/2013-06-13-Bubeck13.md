title: Bounded regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits
abstract: We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem when one knows the value
  μ^(⋆) of an optimal arm, as a well as a positive lower bound on the smallest positive
  gap ∆. We propose a new randomized policy that attains a regret uniformly bounded
  over time in this setting. We also prove several lower bounds, which show in particular
  that bounded regret is not possible if one only knows ∆, and bounded regret of order
  1/∆is not possible if one only knows μ^(⋆).
