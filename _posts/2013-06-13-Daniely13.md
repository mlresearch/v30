title: The price of bandit information in multiclass online classification
abstract: We consider two scenarios of multiclass online learning of a hypothesis
  class H⊆Y^X. In the \em full information scenario, the learner is exposed to instances
  together with their labels. In the \em bandit scenario, the true label is not exposed,
  but rather an indication whether the learner’s prediction is correct or not. We
  show that the ratio between the error rates in the two scenarios is at most 8⋅|Y|⋅\log(|Y|)
  in the realizable case, and \tildeO(\sqrt|Y|) in the agnostic case. The results
  are tight up to a logarithmic factor and essentially answer an open question from
  (Daniely et. al. - Multiclass learnability and the erm principle).We apply these
  results to the class of γ-margin multiclass linear classifiers in \mathbbR^d. We
  show that the bandit error rate of this class is \tildeΘ\left(\frac|Y|γ^2\right)
  in the realizable case and \tildeΘ\left(\frac1γ\sqrt|Y|T\right) in the agnostic
  case. This resolves an open question from (Kakade et. al. - Efficient bandit algorithms
  for onlinemulticlass prediction).
