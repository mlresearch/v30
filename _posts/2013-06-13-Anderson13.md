title: Efficient Learning of Simplices
abstract: 'We show an efficient algorithm for the following problem: Given uniformly
  random points from an arbitrary n-dimensional simplex, estimate the simplex. The
  size of the sample and the number of arithmetic operations of our algorithm are
  polynomial in n. This answers a question of Frieze, Jerrum and Kannan Frieze et
  al. (1996). Our result can also be interpreted as efficiently learning the intersection
  of n + 1 half-spaces in R^n in the model where the intersection is bounded and we
  are given polynomially many uniform samples from it. Our proof uses the local search
  technique from Independent Component Analysis (ICA), also used by Frieze et al.
  (1996). Unlike these previous algorithms, which were based on analyzing the fourth
  moment, ours is based on the third moment.  We also show a direct connection between
  the problem of learning a simplex and ICA: a simple randomized reduction to ICA
  from the problem of learning a simplex. The connection is based on a known representation
  of the uniform measure on a simplex. Similar representations lead to a reduction
  from the problem of learning an affine transformation of an n-dimensional l_p ball
  to ICA.'
