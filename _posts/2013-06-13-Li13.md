title: General Oracle Inequalities for Gibbs Posterior with Application to Ranking
abstract: In this paper, we summarize some recent results in Li et al. (2012), which
  can be used to extend an important PAC-Bayesian approach, namely the Gibbs posterior,
  to study the nonadditive ranking risk. The methodology is based on assumption-free
  risk bounds and nonasymptotic oracle inequalities, which leads to nearly optimal
  convergence rates and optimal model selection to balance the approximation errors
  and the stochastic errors.
