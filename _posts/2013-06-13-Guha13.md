title: Differentially Private Feature Selection via Stability Arguments, and the Robustness
  of the Lasso
abstract: 'We design differentially private algorithms for statistical model selection.
  Given a data set and a large, discrete collection of  “models”, each of which is
  a family of probability distributions, the goal is to determine the model that best
  “fits” the data. This is a basic problem in many areas of statistics and machine
  learning. We consider settings in which there is a well-defined answer, in  the
  following sense: Suppose that there is a \emphnonprivate model  selection procedure
  f, which is the reference to which we compare our performance. Our differentially
  private algorithms output the correct value  f(D) whenever f is \emphstable on the
  input data set D. We work with two notions, \emphperturbation stability and \emphsub-sampling
  stability. We give two classes of results: generic ones, that apply to any function
  with discrete output set; and specific algorithms for the problem of sparse linear
  regression. The algorithms we describe are efficient and in some cases match the
  optimal \emphnon-private asymptotic sample complexity. Our algorithms for sparse
  linear regression require analyzing the stability properties of the popular LASSO
  estimator. We give sufficient conditions for the LASSO estimator to be robust to
  small changes in the data set, and show that these conditions hold with high probability
  under essentially the same stochastic assumptions that are used in the literature
  to analyze convergence of the LASSO.'
