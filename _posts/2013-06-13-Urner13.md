title: 'PLAL: Cluster-based active learning'
abstract: We investigate the label complexity of active learning under some smoothness
  assumptions on the data-generating process.We propose a procedure, PLAL, for “activising”
  passive, sample-based learners. The procedure takes an unlabeledsample, queries
  the labels of some of its members, and outputs a full labeling of that sample. Assuming
  the data satisfies “Probabilistic Lipschitzness”, a notion of clusterability, we
  show that for several common learning paradigms, applying our procedure as a preprocessing
  leads to provable label complexity reductions (over any “passive”learning algorithm,
  under the same data assumptions). Our labeling procedure is simple and easy to implement.
  We complement our theoretical findings with experimental validations.
