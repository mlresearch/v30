title: Surrogate Regret Bounds for the Area Under the ROC Curve via Strongly Proper
  Losses
abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure
  in machine learning, and has been widely studied in recent years particularly in
  the context of bipartite ranking. A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework
  for AUC optimization/bipartite ranking has been to reduce the problem to pairwise
  classification; in particular, it is well known that the AUC regret can be formulated
  as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual
  regret bounds for binary classification. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed
  AUC regret bounds in terms of the regret associated with ‘balanced’ versions of
  the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we obtain
  such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for the AUC in terms of a broad class
  of proper (composite) losses that we term \emphstrongly proper. Our proof technique
  is considerably simpler than that of Kotlowski et al. (2011), and relies on properties
  of proper (composite) losses as elucidated recently by Reid and Williamson (2009,
  2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden
  balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for
  example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses. An important consequence
  is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such
  as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class
  and appropriate regularization), are in fact AUC-consistent; moreover, our results
  allow us to quantify the AUC regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret.
  We also obtain tighter surrogate regret bounds under certain low-noise conditions
  via a recent result of Clémen\con and Robbiano (2011).
