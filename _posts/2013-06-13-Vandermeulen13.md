title: Consistency of Robust Kernel Density Estimators
abstract: The kernel density estimator (KDE) based on a radial positive-semidefinite
  kernel may be viewed as a sample mean in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This
  mean can be viewed as the solution of a least squares problem in that space. Replacing
  the squared loss with a robust loss yields a robust kernel density estimator (RKDE).
  Previous work has shown that RKDEs are weighted kernel density estimators which
  have desirable robustness properties. In this paper we establish asymptotic L^1
  consistency of the RKDE for a class of losses and show that the RKDE converges with
  the same rate on bandwidth required for the traditional KDE. We also present a novel
  proof of the consistency of the traditional KDE.
