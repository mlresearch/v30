title: Competing With Strategies
abstract: 'We study the problem of online learning with a notion of regret defined
  with respect to a set of strategies. We develop tools for analyzing the minimax
  rates and for deriving regret-minimization algorithms in this scenario. While the
  standard methods for minimizing the usual notion of regret fail, through our analysis
  we demonstrate existence of regret-minimization methods that compete with such sets
  of strategies as: autoregressive algorithms, strategies based on statistical models,
  regularized least squares, and follow the regularized leader strategies. In several
  cases we also derive efficient learning algorithms. '
