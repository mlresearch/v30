title: Representation, Approximation and Learning of Submodular Functions Using Low-rank
  Decision Trees
abstract: 'We study the complexity of approximate representation and learning of submodular
  functions over the uniform distribution on the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n. Our main
  result is the following structural theorem: any submodular function is ε-close in
  \ell_2 to a real-valued decision tree (DT) of depth O(1/ε^2). This immediately implies
  that any submodular function is  ε-close to a function of at most 2^O(1/ε^2) variables
  and has a spectral \ell_1 norm of 2^O(1/ε^2). It also implies the closest previous
  result that states that submodular functions can be approximated by polynomials
  of degree O(1/ε^2) (Cheraghchi et al., 2012). Our result is proved by constructing
  an approximation of a submodular function by a DT of rank 4/ε^2 and a proof that
  any rank-r DT can be ε-approximated by a DT of depth \frac52(r+\log(1/ε)). We show
  that these structural results can be exploited to give an attribute-efficient PAC
  learning algorithm for submodular functions running in time \tildeO(n^2) ⋅2^O(1/ε^4).
  The best previous algorithm for the problem requires n^O(1/ε^2) time and examples
  (Cheraghchi et al., 2012) but works also in the agnostic setting. In addition, we
  give improved learning algorithms for a number of related settings. We also prove
  that our PAC and agnostic learning algorithms are essentially optimal via two lower
  bounds: (1) an information-theoretic lower bound of 2^Ω(1/ε^2/3) on the complexity
  of learning monotone submodular functions  in any reasonable model (including learning
  with value queries); (2) computational lower bound of n^Ω(1/ε^2/3) based on a reduction
  to learning of sparse parities with noise, widely-believed to be intractable. These
  are the first lower bounds for learning of submodular functions over the uniform
  distribution.'
