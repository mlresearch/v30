title: 'Open Problem: Fast Stochastic Exp-Concave Optimization  '
abstract: 'Stochastic exp-concave optimization is an important primitive in machine
  learning that captures several fundamental problems, including linear regression,
  logistic regression and more. The exp-concavity property allows for fast convergence
  rates, as compared to general stochastic optimization.  However, current algorithms
  that attain such rates scale poorly with the dimension n and run in time O(n^4),
  even on very simple instances of the problem.  The question we pose is whether it
  is possible to obtain fast rates for exp-concave functions using more computationally-efficient
  algorithms. '
