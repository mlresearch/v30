title: Online Learning with Predictable Sequences
abstract: 'We present methods for online linear optimization that take advantage of
  benign (as opposed to worst-case) sequences. Specifically if the sequence encountered
  by the learner is described well by a known “predictable process”, the algorithms
  presented enjoy tighter bounds as compared to the typical worst case bounds. Additionally,
  the methods achieve the usual worst-case regret bounds if the sequence is not benign.
  Our approach can be seen as a way of adding \emphprior knowledge about the sequence
  within the paradigm of online learning. The setting is shown to encompass partial
  and side information. Variance and path-length bounds can be seen as particular
  examples of online learning with simple predictable sequences.We further extend
  our methods to include competing with a set of possible predictable processes (models),
  that is “learning” the predictable process itself concurrently with using it to
  obtain better regret guarantees. We show that such model selection is possible under
  various assumptions on the available feedback. '
