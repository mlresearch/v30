title: Honest Compressions and Their Application to Compression Schemes
abstract: The existence of a compression scheme for every concept class with bounded
  VC-dimension is one of the oldest open problems in statistical learning theory.
  Here we demonstrate the existence of such compression schemes under stronger assumptions
  than finite VC-dimension. Specifically, for each concept class we associate a family
  of concept classes that we call the alternating concept classes. Under the assumption
  that these concept classes have bounded VC dimension, we prove existence of a compression
  scheme. This result is motivated by recent progress in the field of model theory
  with respect to an analogues problem. In fact, our proof can be considered as a
  constructive proof of these advancements. This means that we describe the reconstruction
  function explicitly. Not less important, the theorems and proofs we present are
  in purely combinatorial terms and are available to the reader who is unfamiliar
  with model theory. Also, using tools from model theory, we apply our results and
  prove existence of compression schemes in interesting cases, such as concept classes
  defined by hyperplanes, polynomials, exponentials, restricted analytic functions
  and compositions, additions and multiplications of all of the above.
