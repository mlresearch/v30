title: Subspace Embeddings and \ell_p-Regression Using Exponential Random Variables
abstract: Oblivious low-distortion subspace embeddings are a crucial building block
  for numerical linear algebra problems. We show for any real p, 1 ≤p < ∞, given a
  matrix M ∈\mathbbR^n \times d with n ≫d, with constant probability we can choose
  a matrix \Pi with \max(1, n^1-2/p) \textpoly(d) rows and n columns so that simultaneously
  for all x ∈\mathbbR^d, \|Mx\|_p ≤\|\Pi Mx\|_∞ ≤\textpoly(d) \|Mx\|_p. Importantly,
  \Pi M can be computed in the optimal O(\textnnz(M)) time, where \textnnz(M) is the
  number of non-zero entries of M. This generalizes all previous oblivious subspace
  embeddings which required p ∈[1,2] due to their use of p-stable random variables.
  Using our new matrices \Pi, we also improve the best known distortion of oblivious
  subspace embeddings of \ell_1 into \ell_1 with \tildeO(d) target dimension in O(\textnnz(M))
  time from \tildeO(d^3) to \tildeO(d^2), which can further be improved to \tildeO(d^3/2)
  \log^1/2 n if d = Ω(\log n), answering a question of Meng and Mahoney (STOC, 2013).
  We apply our results to \ell_p-regression, obtaining a (1+ε)-approximation in O(\textnnz(M)\log
  n) + \textpoly(d/ε) time, improving the best known \textpoly(d/ε) factors for every
  p ∈[1, ∞) ∖{2}. If one is just interested in a \textpoly(d) rather than a (1+ε)-approximation
  to \ell_p-regression, a corollary of our results is that for all p ∈[1, ∞) we can
  solve the \ell_p-regression problem without using general convex programming, that
  is, since our subspace embeds into \ell_∞ it suffices to solve a linear programming
  problem.  Finally, we give the first protocols for the distributed \ell_p-regression
  problem for every p ≥1 which are nearly optimal in communication and computation.
