title: 'Open Problem: Lower bounds for Boosting with Hadamard Matrices '
abstract: Boosting algorithms can be viewed as a zero-sum game. At each iteration
  a new column / hypothesis is chosen from a game matrix representing the entire hypotheses
  class.  There are algorithms for which the gap between the value of the sub-matrix
  (the t columns chosen so far) and the value of the entire game matrix is O(\sqrt\frac\log
  nt).  A matching lower bound has been shown for random game matrices for t up to
  n^αwhere α∈(0,\frac12).  We conjecture that with Hadamard matrices we can build
  a certain game matrix for which the game value grows at the slowest possible rate
  for t up to a fraction of n.
